Movie Seat Booking App

A simple movie seat booking system that allows users to select seats for a movie, view the total price based on the selected movie, and store the selected seats and movie data in localStorage for persistence even after refreshing the page.
Features:

    Select a Movie: Choose a movie from a dropdown list.
    Select Seats: Click on available seats to select them. The selected seats will be highlighted.
    Seat Availability: Occupied seats are marked and cannot be selected.
    Total Price Calculation: The total price updates based on the number of selected seats and the selected movie's price.
    Persistence: Selected seats and movie choice are saved to localStorage so the selection persists even after page refresh.
